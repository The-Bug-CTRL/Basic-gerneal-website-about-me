        <h1>My Personal Bio</h1>
        <p>My name is Andrew Sargeant. I am a young man with hundreds of hours of coding experience. I attended Cambridge International schooling, and I have experience working with people. I have helped friends and family with coding tasks and projects such as websites and apps. Currently, I am busy finishing my Hyperion Dev Software Engineering online bootcamp, and I am at level 2.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about business and entrepreneurship. I love creating businesses and providing products or services in exchange for money and experience. I also enjoy working hard to achieve desired results and high goals I have set for myself.</p>
        <p>I would love to be a junior developer for any career path that involves Python or similar languages. I am also interested in starting a business using my coding skills to create complex and valuable products.</p>
